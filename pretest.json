      "question": "10 volt source is connected in series with resistor 20 ohm and 30 ohm. What will be the voltage across the resistor 30 ohm?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "10V",
        "b": "8V",
        "c": "6V",
        "d": "4V"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. 10V is the total source voltage.",
        "b": "Incorrect. 8V would require different resistor values.",
        "c": "Correct. Voltage across 30Î© = (30 / (20 + 30)) * 10V = 6V",
        "d": "Incorrect. 4V is too low."
