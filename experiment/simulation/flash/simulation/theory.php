  <p class="content">Metre bridge consist of a uniform resistance wire AC, one meter long, kept stretched between two copper strips fixed on a wooden board. Another copper strip is fixed centrally between the other two on the board leaving two gaps between the strips. The copper strips are provided with terminals.</p><br/>
      <p class="contentTitleSmall"> Theory</p><br/>
  <p class="content"> The metre  bridge is working under Wheat stone's principle. Four resistances P, Q, R and S are connected as shown in the figure (1) so as to form a closed network.  </p>

  <p class="content"> If no current flows through the galvanometer, then we have the Wheatstone's principle <img src="<?php echo $full_path ?>img2.jpg" align="absmiddle"  /></p>
  <p class="content">If three resistances are known, the fourth one can be calculated. In a meter bridge let an unknown resistance X is connected across the left gap G<sub>1</sub> and a resistance box R in the right gap G<sub>2</sub>.Here the Wheatstone's principle becomes</p><br/>

 But resistance of AB and CB are proportional to their length. Let AB=l cm and CB=(100-l) cm because AC=1m=100cm</p><br/>
