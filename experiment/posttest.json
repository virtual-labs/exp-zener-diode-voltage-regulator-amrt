      "question": "If 6 volt zener diode is connected across 10 volt battery, what will be the voltage across zener diode?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "4V",
        "b": "6V",
        "c": "8V",
        "d": "10V"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. 4V is below breakdown voltage.",
        "b": "Correct. Zener maintains its breakdown voltage, which is 6V.",
        "c": "Incorrect. 8V is above zener voltage.",
        "d": "Incorrect. 10V would damage the diode."

      "question": "Which of the following statement is true?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Zener diode is similar with ordinary diode",
        "b": "Zener diode is commonly used under reverse biasing condition",
        "c": "Zener diode can operate at any range of current",
        "d": "Zener diode is used to rectify the signals"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. It differs in reverse breakdown operation.",
        "b": "Correct. Zener diodes are designed to operate in reverse bias.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Zener has a limited current range.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Rectification is done using ordinary diodes."

    {
      "question": "What one is not required for zener voltage regulator?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Series resistance must be maximum to protect the zener diode",
        "b": "Load resistance is greater than series resistance",
        "c": "Supply voltage must not less than zener voltage",
        "d": "Series resistance has minimum value to feed maximum current"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Series resistance must be appropriately chosen, not maximum.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Load resistance is typically greater.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Supply must exceed zener voltage.",
        "d": "Correct. Series resistance should not be too low or it will damage the zener."
