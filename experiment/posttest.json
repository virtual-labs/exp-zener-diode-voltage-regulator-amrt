      "question": "If 6 volt zener diode is connected across 10 volt battery, what will be the voltage across zener diode?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "4V",
        "b": "6V",
        "c": "8V",
        "d": "10V"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. 4V is below breakdown voltage.",
        "b": "Correct. Zener maintains its breakdown voltage, which is 6V.",
        "c": "Incorrect. 8V is above zener voltage.",
        "d": "Incorrect. 10V would damage the diode."
      },

      "question": "Which of the following statement is true?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Zener diode is similar with ordinary diode",
        "b": "Zener diode is commonly used under reverse biasing condition",
        "c": "Zener diode can operate at any range of current",
        "d": "Zener diode is used to rectify the signals"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. It differs in reverse breakdown operation.",
        "b": "Correct. Zener diodes are designed to operate in reverse bias.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Zener has a limited current range.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Rectification is done using ordinary diodes."

    {
      "question": "What one is not required for zener voltage regulator?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Supply voltage must be higher than Zener voltage",
        "b": "A load resistance connected in parallel with the Zener diode",
        "c": "A properly chosen series resistor to limit current",
        "d": "A very high series resistance to completely block current"
      },
